    <h1>Branding</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Task description:</b> Come up with a brand name and create a logotype
      for the following company: In the very north of Sweden, rich in forests
      and unspoiled nature, two childhood friends has for many years produced
      and sold a locally produced Gin at selected Systembolaget stores in
      northern Sweden. The Gin is flavoured with the juniper berries from the
      surrounding forests. They have never had any proper branding for the
      bottles though, and the labels has varied somewhat throughout the years.
      Now they have secured a deal for a larger launch throughout Sweden and
      northern Europe and need your help coming up with a brand name, logo and a
      visual identity. The brand is not exclusive but wants to be perceived as
      clean and modern but still close-to-nature.
