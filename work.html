              <b>Task description:</b> Choose a design-related subject. It can
              be pretty much anything. A specific designer, a specific field of
              design or just a piece of art you enjoy. Historical or
              contemporary. Write a text of your own about your selected topic.
              The text should be written as if you were an author writing for a
              coffee table book on art/design. This is not an academic paper.
              Design a minimum of two spreads, maximum of four (4-8 pages) about
              your topic intended for a coffee table book about design. For this
              assignment it is permitted to borrow pictures from the internet.

              <b>Task description:</b> Take a picture, an object or a concept
              and simplify it. Your final design can be a pictogram, an
              ideogram, an icon or a minimalistic poster. Your final design
              should be done as vector graphics using Illustrator. It is ok to
              make a “popular culture stylization” taking inspiration from
              movies, tv-series, video games and music. Clarify and simplify. Be
              creative. Have fun!

            <p>
              <b>Task description:</b> Come up with a brand name and create a
              logotype for the following company: In the very north of Sweden,
              rich in forests and unspoiled nature, two childhood friends has
              for many years produced and sold a locally produced Gin at
              selected Systembolaget stores in northern Sweden. The Gin is
              flavoured with the juniper berries from the surrounding forests.
              They have never had any proper branding for the bottles though,
              and the labels has varied somewhat throughout the years. Now they
              have secured a deal for a larger launch throughout Sweden and
              northern Europe and need your help coming up with a brand name,
              logo and a visual identity. The brand is not exclusive but wants
              to be perceived as clean and modern but still close-to-nature.
